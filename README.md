Welcome to Advanced Java! This is an opportunity for students to write multithreaded object-oriented code using Java frameworks and determine how to deploy software applications using cloud services.
Modify a Spring application with a Java back end and an Angular front end to include multithreaded language translation, a message at different time zones, and currency exchange. Then, build a Docker image of the current multithreaded Spring application and containerize it using the supporting documents provided in this task.
